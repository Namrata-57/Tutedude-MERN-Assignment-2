# 🕹️ Reaction Time Tester

A simple and interactive web-based reaction time tester. Click on the box as quickly as possible once it appears. The application will calculate and display your reaction time to help you track and improve your speed.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a web application where users test their reaction speed by clicking a randomly appearing and moving box. After each successful click, the app calculates and displays the user's reaction time.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into three separate files:

- `index.html` – Contains the HTML structure of the app.
- `styles.css` – Responsible for layout, colors, and styling.
- `script.js` – Handles logic: random box movement, reaction time calculation, and display.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ All text is centered for clear visibility.
- ✅ The box appears at random locations with random sizes.
- ✅ The box changes color after each click.
- ✅ Displays reaction time in seconds.
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback after each click.
- ✅ Clean and readable code following best practices.

## 💡 How It Works

1. A box appears on the screen at a random location.
2. When the user clicks the box, it records how long it took.
3. The result is displayed on the screen.
4. The box disappears and reappears again in a new place with a new color.

## 🧼 Clean Code Practices

- Descriptive variable names.
- Modular functions with clear responsibilities.
- Commented code for better understanding.
- Removed all unused or redundant lines.
